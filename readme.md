#view lifecycle

i created a directive to show the view lifecycle

the directive is : lifeCycle

you can put in the '<ion-view>' element:

example 
'<ion-view life-cycle view-title="Account" >'

im using the view-title="xxxx" to identify the view;

when you navigate from and to that view you can see the console;

also you can perform some methods 


you can see when you ente on account tabs, i add a number on top of the list even if the view is cached

thats is really usefull
